        nature of matter this information was withheld from public prevent panic and chaos. Immediate mass production of
        teleportation devices, called \"Blink\", was requested from government. One Blink can only be used to go back to
        a specific place and come back to the place that it was used. Unfortunately yesterday four of the Blink\'s
        were stolen from company vault. There are no suspects since the project is classified as top secret and only a
        handful of people knows the company vault passcode. It is possible that duplication of can be achieved by third parties
